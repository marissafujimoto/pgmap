\title{Making a new gimap dataset}
\usage{
setup_data(
  counts = NULL,
  pg_ids = NULL,
  pg_metadata = NULL,
  sample_metadata = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{a matrix of data that contains the counts where rows are each paired_guide target and columns are each sample}

\item{pg_ids}{the pgRNA IDs: metadata associated with the pgRNA constructs that correspond to the rows of the counts data}

\item{pg_metadata}{construct metadata}

\item{sample_metadata}{metadata associated with the samples of the dataset that correspond to the columns of the counts data.
Should include a column that has replicate information as well as a column that contains timepoint information respectively (this will be used for log fold calculations). These columns should be factors.}
}
\value{
A special gimap_dataset to be used with the other functions in this package.
}
\description{
This function allows people to have their data ready to be processed by gimap
}

\dontrun{

example_counts <- get_example_data("count") \%>\%
  dplyr::select(c("Day00_RepA", "Day05_RepA", "Day22_RepA", "Day22_RepB", "Day22_RepC")) \%>\%

# You can see what an example dataset looks like by pulling the example gimap_dataset:
gimap_dataset <- get_example_data("gimap")
