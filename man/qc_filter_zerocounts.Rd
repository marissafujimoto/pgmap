\title{Create a filter for pgRNAs which have a raw count of 0 for any sample/time point}
\usage{
qc_filter_zerocounts(gimap_dataset, filter_zerocount_target_col = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{gimap_dataset}{The special gimap_dataset from the `setup_data` function which contains the raw count data}

\item{filter_zerocount_target_col}{default is NULL; Which sample column(s) should be used to check for counts of 0? If NULL and not specified, downstream analysis will select all sample columns}
}
\value{
a named list with the filter `filter` specifying which pgRNA have a count zero for at least one sample/time point and a report df `reportdf` for the number and percent of pgRNA which have a count zero for at least one sample/time point
}
\description{
This function flags and reports which and how many pgRNAs have a raw count of 0 for any sample/time point
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  gimap_dataset <- get_example_data("gimap")
  qc_filter_zerocounts(gimap_dataset)

  #or to specify a different column (or set of columns to select)
  qc_filter_zerocount(gimap_dataset, filter_zerocount_target_col = 1:2)
}
